ðŸ“Œ Balanced Risk Set Matching â€“ Data Analytics Assignment
This project implements Balanced Risk Set Matching (BRSM), an advanced matching method for observational studies. Instead of simple nearest-neighbor matching, we use:

âœ… Mahalanobis Distance â€“ A statistical measure of similarity
âœ… Integer Programming â€“ For optimal treatment-control matching
âœ… Sensitivity Analysis â€“ Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test to detect bias
